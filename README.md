# Linear Algebra Psuedocode

A Pseudo-Code Outline of a Linear Algebra Library

## Goal/Purpose:
This library is part of my own learning as a coder/programmer. Being predominantly self-taught, I've found that there are often "gaps" in my knowledge. I may know how to make something work, for example, but not really understand why it needs to be done a certain way. Filling those gaps not only increases my theoretical knowledge and understanding of how computers and programs work, it often gives me significant practical insights into how to write better, more efficient, more readable code.

In my primary work, there are three main languages that are used most often: PHP, JavaScript, and Python (with the first two being much more significant to my career thus far and the third more a professional interest for future endeavors). While much of what I am learning is broadly applicable across a number of subject fields, I am primarily interested in the application of this knowledge in these three languages in particular.

So as one exercise in developing my skills in these three languages, I intend to build libraries for linear algebra computations in all three languages. This repository will serve a pseudocode starting place, an outline of what those libraries will contain, tests for them, and the overall structure of their logic. It is written primarily following the systematic program design principles I've learned in the "How to Design Programs" courses from the University of British Colombia.

## Disclaimer: What This Library is Not

I make not claims whatsoever that this library will be the best, fastest, most comprehensive, or most reliable way to do linear algebra computations in any of the languages I will work in. It's not designed for that, it's designed for me to work through the process of Test Driven, Systematic Development and learn with a practical application. It may be that it turns out this library (or the actual PHP, JavaScript, and Python libraries based on it) are great and ready to use in wide production. Maybe I'll even use them in future projects. It may just as likely turn out that while they were good learning exercises, they have other technical problems that make them inadequate to much real use. And that's fine. At the end of the day, I'm not making this library for any other reason than to learn and experiment. So don't expect it to be anything more than experimental quality.
